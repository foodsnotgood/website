        <p class="font-weight-bold">It's been a year since I decided to enroll the evening program at <a href="www.thomasmore.be" target="blank">Thomas More</a> to study programming.
            To be honest I would have never thought that my life would go into such direction. Being a highschool dropout and having worked 
            with my hands and mostly wood all my life, the idea of working with a computer in an office seemed kind of alien and strange to me.

            I am a creator. I like to make things and see them come to life. Let me tell you: to take a log of exquisite mahogony and working it with a fine japanese chisel to get it
            into the shape you had imagined is quite satisfying. 
        </p>
        <p>
            And yet... I've grown tired of it. Chances are, when you're a trained woodworker you'll be stuck in a repetitive environment where other people do the creating and thinking for you.
            Mostly, ironicly to me, people working with computers. Realizing this made me first look into other professions. And after not so long I found programming to be something I would 
            definitely want to check out.
        </p>
        <p>
            Long story short: Corona happened, and it seemed like the perfect time to pursue that idea. I got myself enrolled and before I knew it I was sitting in a class with my brand new laptop
            learning all about variables, instances, methods and queries.<br>
            One year later I find myself quite overwhelmed with what I had learned. I built my first website and had even made a little game (text and console based, but still).
            The endless possibilities one has in creating something are absolutely breathtaking to me. And I have only learned the basics so far. With curiosity I am looking forward
            to see how to implement databases in a program and get some kind of actual application running.
        </p>
        <p>
            And this is why I started this blog. I strongly believe that when you try to explain something you had just learned, chances are that your brain will make more synapsical 
            (is that a word?) connections deeply embedding the just gained knowledge. Plus anyone who might actually take the time to read this might benefit from it.
        </p>
        <p>
            So without further ado, welcome to my blog about my journey to become a programmer.
